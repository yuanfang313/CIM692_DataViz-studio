          <em class="ja2">Sanlian Lifeweek </em> is a magazine in China, which was first founded in <span class="ja2">1925</span> (known as Life weekly then). In <span class="ja2">1926</span>, <span class="ja2">Zou Taofen</span> (邹韬奋) became editor
          of the magazine and
          <em>“changed its mission from vocational education to political reporting and social criticism”.</em> The magazine increased in circulation under Zou’s editorship from 2,800 in 1925 to 80,000
          in 1930. In 1932, it created the highest circulation record in China, which issued 150,000 copies per issue. In <span class="ja2">1933</span>, it was closed by the government.

        <p class="th2_text container">Now, <em class="ja2">Sanlian lifeweek </em> is one of the most respectful media in China. So, I decided to do some analysis of the headlines
          on the covers of <em class="ja2">Sanlian Lifeweek</em> from <span class="ja2">2003 – 2018</span> (the time range that’s covered by its <a href="http://www.lifeweek.com.cn/magazine/lifeweek/2019/">archive online</a>), to see how its contents

        <p>This is a project about the analysis of the contents on the cover of a magazine, Sanlian Lifeweek,
          which is at least one of the most respectful media in China.
          On the cover of Sanlian Lifeweek, the main contents are in its headlines and image. So, my analysis
          focus on the patterns in the two areas.</p>

      <h2 class="title_ch">A world on the cover</h2>
      <p class="th2_text container">When I started to think about my perspective of this project, I asked myself a wired question: <em class="ja2">what
          would it be like if a person just lives in “a world on the cover”</em> ? The answer might be: the person
        will never know he or she lives “on the cover”, and will never fully know about this world. Somehow,
        it is also true for ourselves.
      </p>
      <p class="th2_text container">
        Although “the world” on the cover of <em>Sanlian Lifeweek</em> is just a tiny fragment of the reflection of
        our “real world”, one way to approach our own reality might be to find those “fragments”, and
        piece them together.
